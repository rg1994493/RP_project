# RP_project
Robot programming C++ project

Objective:
General idea: 
- Implement two different Artificial intelligence search algorithms (DFS and BFS) in C++ to find the solution of a maze input introduced by user.
Specifics: 
- Build and run with CMake
- Use templates in Stack and Queue data structures
- Use of std library for vector and matrix

General idea of the program:
- Save a .txt file with a maze shape (see example below) that will work as input for the C++ program
  Maze characteristics:
   A - Starting point
   B - Goal Point
   "#" - Wall
   
- Run the program and receive a visual solution by the method chosen in the terminal, with the corresponding nodes explored to arrive to the solution.
